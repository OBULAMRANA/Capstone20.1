### Project Overview:
The  project is to identify  effective ways for predicting housing price based on the dataset. We will be training and tuning different set of classification & regression models to accurately predict the price. We will then evaluate and compare the models' performances to identify the best one, then further scrutinize it to find the most effective features that enhance performance.

### Dataset information
This dataset contains a wide variety of columns, offering a rich foundation for applying various encoding techniques for categorical data. By combining both numerical and categorical features, it becomes possible to build robust pipeline models for predicting house sale prices.

Given dataset has 
Total number of columns : 81
Total number of rows : 1460

## House Price Prediction Using The Dataset
An overview of the question to be solved in the capstone :
housing price are more volatile and depends on different factors. This project is to identify more effective ways for predicting housing price

## Identification of the type of data that will be used to solve the question:
The dataset will contain the house related information like area, built year, lot size, number of bed rooms, rest rooms,sale price ...etc

## List of 1–3 techniques that could be used to answer the question identified.:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data preparation, Cleaning the data, Understand the data, examine relationships using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & : Reduce dimensionality to identify and retain the most significant features contributing to house price.

Clustering : Apply clustering to uncover groups of houses with similar catagories like built-year, price, area. These clusters can offer insight on sale/price patterns and may be used as additional features in the final predictive model.
