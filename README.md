## House Price Prediction Using The Dataset
An overview of the question to be solved in the capstone :
housing price are more volatile and depends on different factors. This project is to identify more effective ways for predicting housing price

## Identification of the type of data that will be used to solve the question:
The dataset will contain the house related information like area, built year, lot size, number of bed rooms, rest rooms,sale price ...etc

## List of 1â€“3 techniques that could be used to answer the question identified.:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data preparation, Cleaning the data, Understand the data, examine relationships using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & : Reduce dimensionality to identify and retain the most significant features contributing to house price.

Clustering : Apply clustering to uncover groups of houses with similar catagories like built-year, price, area. These clusters can offer insight on sale/price patterns and may be used as additional features in the final predictive model.
